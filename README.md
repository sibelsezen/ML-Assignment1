# ML-Project1
Consider the attached wine dataset from the UCI machine learning repository:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine. The data are the results of a chemical analysis of
wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis
determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines.
All attributes are continuous. NOTE: 1st attribute is class identifier (1-3).
Use 70% of the data in each class for training a Naive Bayes classifier and the remaining 30% to
test the classifier performance based on given 13 attributes as:
1) Alcohol
2) Malic acid
3) Ash
4) Alcalinity of ash
5) Magnesium
6) Total phenols
7) Flavanoids
8) Nonflavanoid phenols
9) Proanthocyanins
10)Color intensity
11)Hue
12)OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
13)Proline
